Analysis and Findings

Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Explored the dataset to understand its structure and cleaned the data by handling missing values ​​and coding categorical variables.

Customer Segmentation

Cluster 0: Younger customers with lower average credit limits but higher utilization rates.

Group 1: Older customers with higher credit limits and lower utilization rates.
Predictive Modeling

built predictive models to predict customer turnover using logistic regression and random forest classifiers. Key performance metrics are:

Logistic regression: Accuracy - X, ROC AUC - Y
Random Forest: Accuracy - X, ROC AUC - Y
Conclusion

This analysis provided useful information for targeted marketing strategies and customer retention. programs By understanding the characteristics of customer segments, companies can adapt their services to the specific needs of each group.
